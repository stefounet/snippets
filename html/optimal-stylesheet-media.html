  OPTIMAL DECLARATION OF BIG SCREEN AND SMALL (MOBILE) SCREEN STYLESHEETS
  By http://goetter.fr in http://forum.alsacreations.com/topic-27-58389-1.html
  
  Big/small screen threshold: it might be useful to change the 480/481px
  values to something slightly bigger to accomodate some Android devices.

  We're using Media Queries to address one stylesheet or the other to
  browsers. The use of the media query syntax has a filtering effect
  (browsers with no media query support will discard the link element).
  Right now (2011+) web browsers with no Media Queries support are mostly
  IE 6-8 (desktop and mobile versions, including IE7 Mobile on WP7.0),
  and we can use conditional comments to serve the right stylesheets to
  these browsers.
